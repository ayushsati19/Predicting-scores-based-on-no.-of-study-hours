# Predicting-scores-based-on-no.-of-study-hours
This is a machine learning project that predicts scores based on the number of study hours. The dataset used for this project has two columns: "Hours" and "Scores". Since the project has only one independent variable, simple linear regression has been used.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available in the file data.csv. It contains 25 rows and 2 columns. The first column represents the number of hours a student has studied, while the second column represents the score obtained by the student.

# Dependencies
This project requires the following Python packages:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib

Conclusion
This is a simple project that demonstrates how simple linear regression can be used to predict scores based on the number of study hours. Feel free to explore the code and dataset to gain a better understanding of how the model works.
